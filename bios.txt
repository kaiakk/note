Robert Lisek PhD is an artist, mathematician and composer who focus on exploring complex dynamic environments (biological, computational, social) and creating agents that learns to learn by 'feedback' with evolving environment and transform methods/algorithms it uses. He is involved in the number of projects focused on media art, immersive art and storytelling. Drawing upon post-conceptual art, software art and meta-media, his work intentionally defies categorization. Lisek is a pioneer of art based on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Lisek is also a composer of contemporary music, author of many projects on the intersection of spectral, stochastic, AI music and noise. His scientific research interests are category theory and high-order algebras. He is the author of 300 exhibitions and concerts, among others in Ircam Center Pompidou, ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe, MAXXI Rome, STEIM Amsterdam, PRADO Museum, WORM Rotterdam, ARCO Madrid, Venice Biennale, LMCC NYC, Ars Electronic, Siggraph, etc. More: http://fundamental.art.pl

Karolína Kotnour is an architect and artist dedicated to an architectural spatial and audio-visual production. She is focused on creating future evolving architecture by transforming methods from neuroscience, machine learning, immersive and sound spatialization research. In her projects and installations, she connects and synchronizes architectural and sound structures. She claims 'the reciprocal confrontation of sound waves as is a liberated contour of space'. She interests in 'space as evolving over time, in parallels and mutual confrontations and reflections'. A significant role plays human acoustic presence and performance. She observes extreme space phenomena e.g.: „acoustic black holes“ and transformation of sound vibrations in their surroundings. She is Ph.D. research fellow at FLOW studio at Faculty of Architecture CTU in Prague.
